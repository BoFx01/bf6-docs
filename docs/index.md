# Welcome

This site is an unoffcial developer reference for scripting in Battlefield 6 Portal. **This project is in the very early stages and most content is not yet written.** Please consider contributing to help build out the documentation.

The current priority is to document `mod` and `modlib` in the `API Reference` section. This section should explain all of the event handlers, functions, types, and other objects. Working examples should be included when possible.

Once API Reference is complete, the next step is to create more user-friendly guides and tutorials.
